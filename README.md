# Ubuntu: Suggestions for Improvements

## Super-key --> Search everything --> Install App

Imagine I want to use Audacity, but have not installed it yet. If I hit the Super-key and then type "Audacity" I want a simple button to install it.
I don't want this feature for every tiny package which exists for Ubuntu. But the most common applications should be installable like this.

## Autostart
I want to enter "Super-key autostart". And then I want a simple way to add a tool which should get started automatically. I want to add a script to autostart without using a internet search engine.

## Chromium file upload: via Google-Drive

I took a foto of a couch which I want to sell at ebay. I uploaded the foto to google drive.
Now I need to upload the foto to ebay. Grrr the image is not easily accessible. The "upload file" dialog
of Chromium should have a simple way to fetch files from gdrive/nextcloud/dropbox/....


## Less flavours of Ubuntu

There are several [flavours of Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours).

I think maintaining them costs time and money.

It is not my time and money, but it would be my time and money, I would reduce the number of flavours.
