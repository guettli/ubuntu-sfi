# Ubuntu: Suggestions for Improvements

Imagine I want to use Audacity, but have not installed it yet. If I hit the Super-key and then type "Audacity" I want a simple button to install it.
I don't want this feature for every tiny package which exists for Ubuntu. But the most common applications should be installable like this.

I want to enter "Super-key autostart". And then I want a simple way to add a tool which should get started automatically. I want to add a script to autostart without using a internet search engine.
